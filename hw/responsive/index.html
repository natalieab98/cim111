      <p id="about">  My passion for public relations, writing, and fashion has always been a significant part of my life in the bustling and dynamic setting of New York. I study public relations as a student in the Honors Program in the School of Communications at the University of Miami. I am a writer with a demonstrated history of working in the newspaper and magazine industry. I enjoy using my skills in Adobe programs, creativity, organization, and interaction with others while remaining energetic.</p>
